UNI Clicker is a compact development board designed as a complete solution. It contains a MCU Card socket, four mikroBUS sockets for Click boards connectivity and power management. 

Its core is a MCU Card socket that allows UNI Clicker to use different microcontrollers mounted on a standardized MCU Card. The MCU Card can be connected to the UNI Clicker by two 168-pin mezzanine connectors, one male and one female. This MCU Card supports architectures such as ARM, PIC32, dsPIC, PIC, AVR, Microchip, ST, NXP, TI and more.

UNI Clicker can be powered on by a small switch at the edge of the board. Therefore, the PSU (Power Supply Unit) module will be enabled and the power will be distributed. The PWR LED indicates that the board is ON.
